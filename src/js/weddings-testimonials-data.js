   Real client reviews shown in the weddings-page marquee when the
   CMS API is unreachable. The live site prefers testimonials the
   client flags "Show on weddings page" in the dashboard; this is
   only the safety net so the section is never empty.

   `src` mirrors the testimonials-page card photo. In production the
   couple's uploaded photo (dashboard) is used instead; these stock
   shots only appear in offline/fallback mode.
